This is the attempt to create a ruby-written dzen-based info-environment for the linux-desktop.


== How to use
# Launch the statusbar
$ ./bin/statusbar


== Dependencies
- >= ruby 1.8.7 (perhaps lower version)
- >= ruby-dbus bindings 0.4 (http://github.com/mvidner/ruby-dbus)
- >= dzen2 0.8.5 + standard gadgets
- Standard GNU file utilities (http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils)

Note: Some of these dependencies are just temporary. They get removed or exchanged by something better over time. Also note, that itâ€™s an ease to remove some of the deps by changing a few lines in the code.
