dzen-environment

This is the attempt to create a ruby-written dzen-based info-environment for the linux-desktop.

The source at this stage is a result of a 5 hour session of messing around. ;-) So it's really not to use. If you decide otherwise despite my recommendation, the whole stuff can be used as follows:

$ ./statusbar.rb | dzen2
$ ./wlan_networkmanager.rb

Let's see how far it goes!
